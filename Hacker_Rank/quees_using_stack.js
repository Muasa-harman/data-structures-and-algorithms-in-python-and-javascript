// A queue is an abstract datatype that maintains the order in which elements were added to it, allowing the oldest
// elements to be reomved from the front and a new element to be added to the rear.
// A basic queue has the following operations:
//  . Enqueue - add a new element to the end of the queue
//  . Dequeue - remove element from the front of the queue and return it.A

//  In this challenge, you must implement a queue using two stack. Then process q queries, where each query is one of the
//  following 3 types:
//  1. 1 x: Enqueue element x into the end of the queue.
//  2. 2: Dequeue the elements from the front of the queue
//  3. 3: Print the elements at the front of the queue

// //  Input Format
// The first line contains single integer. q denoting number of queries.
// Each line i of the q subsequent lines contains a single query in the form described in the problem statement above
// All  3 queries start with an integer denoting the query type but only query 1 is followed by an additional space-separated
// value. x denoting the value to be enqueued.

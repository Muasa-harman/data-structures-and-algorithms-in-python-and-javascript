// You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to.
// and cooling time navigator, Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task.
// Tasks can be completed in any order but there is a constraint. Identical tasks must be separated by at
// least n intervals due to cooling time. Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

// E.g1
// Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
// Output:8

// E.g2
// Input: tasks = ["A","C","A",]

// Time 0(N log N)
// Space:0(N)

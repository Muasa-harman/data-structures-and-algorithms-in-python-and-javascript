# Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a,b,c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? 
# Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero

# NB: Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets

# E.g1:
# Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
# Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]

# E.g2:
# Input: nums = []
# Output:[]
